# neural_neophyte
A python based neural net environment that learns to play discrete sequential games. 

It's easy, it's fast, it's good for you... Well, not quite yet :) 
It still is:
Work in progress!

--------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
- python 3.x
- numPy >= 1.7.1
- sciPy >= 0.11
- theano (tested on 0.8.1) 
- probably more to come..

--------------------------------------------------

Installation:

-Windows:
see Linux installation. Until now both installations are the same.

-Linux:
Install the listed requirements. (I recommend an anaconda installation to get most of the python side-packages such as numPy or sciPy).

Clone the repository with #git clone https://github.com/TheMadDuck/neural_neophyte.git <yourWorkingDirectory>. 
(If you do not have git installed: Download the code with the 'Download ZIP'-Button. And extract it in your working directory. But try to use git. It makes your life easy (sort of..))

Run the neural_neophyte.py file with #python neural_neophyte.py .

--------------------------------------------------

Known isues:
- we are not flawless 
- issues is written with two s
- the code is not yet complete

--------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting:
- the AI_environment.py returns that SIGNAL is assigned before global declaration. Try to run the script a second time. 
 
Good Luck and Have Fun.
