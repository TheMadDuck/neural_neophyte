# neural_neophyte
A C++ based neural net environment that learns to play discrete sequential games. 

It's easy, it's fast, it's good for you... Well, not quite yet :) 
It still is:
Work in progress!

--------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
For the Cpp-build (recomended):
- gcc >= 4.9.2 (or your prefered C++11 compiler)
- cmake >= 3.0.2 (or your prefered build system)

For the Pyhton-build (not recomended):
- python 3.x
- numPy >= 1.7.1
- sciPy >= 0.11
- theano (tested on 0.8.1) 
- probably more to come..

--------------------------------------------------
Installation of the Cpp-build (recomended):

-Windows:
not yet tested.

-Linux:
Install the listed requirements. 
Clone the repository with #git clone https://github.com/TheMadDuck/neural_neophyte.git <yourWorkingDirectory>. 
(If you do not have git installed: Download the code with the 'Download ZIP'-Button. And extract it in your working directory. But try to use git. It makes your life easy (sort of..))

Go in the neural_neophyte/Cpp/ - repository.
run: cmake ./NeuralNeophyteCpp/
run: make
run the programm with: ./NeuralNeophyteCpp

--------------------------------------------------

Installation of the Python-build (not recomended):

-Windows:
see Linux installation. Until now both installations are the same.

-Linux:
Install the listed requirements. (I recommend an anaconda installation to get most of the python side-packages such as numPy or sciPy).

Clone the repository with #git clone https://github.com/TheMadDuck/neural_neophyte.git <yourWorkingDirectory>. 
(If you do not have git installed: Download the code with the 'Download ZIP'-Button. And extract it in your working directory. But try to use git. It makes your life easy (sort of..))

Run the neural_neophyte.py file with #python neural_neophyte.py .

--------------------------------------------------

Known isues:
- we are not flawless 
- issues is written with two s
- the code is not yet complete

--------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting:
- the Neural Net implementation is not ready yet.

--------------------------------------------------
  
Good Luck and Have Fun.
